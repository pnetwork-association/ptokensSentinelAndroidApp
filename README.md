### :wrench: Build the rust library

After you have pulled the submodules for this repo, please navigate to:

```
./rust/ptokens-core-private/v3_bridges/evm/sentinel-strongbox/
```

and read the `README.md` there.

There also exists a helper script in this repo to compile the rust library. It requires some environment variable, the particulars of which are outlined in the aforementioned `README.md`.

Once you've sorted out your environment you can build the rust lib by running:

```
npm run buildRustLibs
```
